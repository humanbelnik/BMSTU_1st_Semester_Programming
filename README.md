# BMSTU_1st_Semester_Programming
Here is my completed laboratory tasks for Programming class.
1st Semester in BMSTU.
Coded in Python.

UPD from 28.11.2022:
Done with the 12th lab. It was a tough one. Spend so many time making it. Still not ideal. Work unproperly if there're sentences which are ended up with "!" or "?".
Don't like the code. I think, it can be rewritten with more accuracy and beauty. 
Thought: Solve the problem on the paper first in order to prevent stupid errors.

Figured out how to write a proper code at about 10th Lab, so don't blame.
